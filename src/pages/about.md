We are a community centered around the masjid near the intersection Courtright Rd. and Groves Rd. We are here to serve the central Ohio Muslims and be a community center for the Oromo Muslims living in central. Our guiding principles sit on enjoining the good and forbidding the evil.

> "وَلْتَكُنْ مِنْكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ" Surat Ali 'Imran Ayat 104

> "And let there be \[arising\] from you a nation inviting to \[all that is\] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful." - Quran \[3:104\]
