Mosques are not only a place for praying, it's the center of the community and where many wonderful pieces of Islamic art have been created.

Mosques are the heart of the Islamic life. They serve for prayers, for events during Islam's holiest month Ramadan, as centers for education and information, places for social welfare, and also for dispute settlement. The **iman** is the religious leader of the mosque and the person who leads the prayers.

Mosques are as old as Islam. According to Islamic tradition, the **Prophet Muhammad \[May Peace Be Upon Him\]** helped in the construction of the first mosque in the city of Medina, as part of his will to define a place of worship for Muslims. The area around the Kaaba Stone in Mecca is often considered the oldest Muslim place of worship, venerated since the 7th century. Both cities are in today's Saudi Arabia and are considered the holiest cities in Islam.
